# Prompt page for LaTex template creation

## Article Lualatex

Create a academic and professional article .tex template. Strictly only use lualatex. Use Arabic and English. The main font is Libertinus Serif and the Arabic font is Scheherazade New. I am going to run this .tex template over .md files that are ready to be published into articles. These .md files are stored in an obsidian vault. The layout should be professional to North America standards, with unique and professional margins, headings, spacing, header, and footer. The aesthetic and aim is for an academic Islamic Studies journal like Brill.
